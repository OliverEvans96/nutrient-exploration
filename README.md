Estimate Ingredient Quantities from Nutrient Info

---

[Here](ConstrainedOptimization.ipynb), we develop an algorithm to estimate a recipe based on nutrient data, and [here](RecipeWidget.ipynb), we have an interactive widget to test it out with real vegetable data! (I love vegetable data :D)

Run the notebooks in the cloud with binder!
